        Artist Statement: 
For this project I collected data of my own personal text messages to create a fun interactive game. Through this project I had a great time going through old messages with friends and family to compile enough messages to make the game interesting. While creating this game I knew that I wanted there to be a bunch of different interactive pieces to make the game appealing to players. This is why I decided to create different customizations for the characters as well as the backgrounds.<a href="https://julianar95.github.io/Project2_Riley/">"GitHub"</a>
